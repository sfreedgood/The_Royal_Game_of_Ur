					"The object of the game is for a player to move all of their pieces along the course and off the board before his or her opponent. There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.

					The object of the game is for a player to move all of their pieces along the course and off the board before his or her opponent. There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a player rolls a number using the dice, he or she may choose to move any of his or her pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if he or she still has pieces that have not entered the game. Players are required to move a piece whenever possible. In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one. If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, he or she may not remove the piece from the board." - Wikipedia

 When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture, but, when it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning. This means there are six "safe" squares and eight "combat" squares.
 A player is not required to capture a piece every time he or she has the opportunity.
 If a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture.
